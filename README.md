# MicroPython  GDEW0213Z16 e-paper display driver with landscape mode



Modified from mcauser's driver epaper2in13b (https://github.com/mcauser/micropython-waveshare-epaper). Tested for the e-ink screen https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.7ef72e8dOGFu9a&id=704511276535&_u=f1la2tr06c8 and the breakout board https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.7ef72e8dOGFu9a&id=680144088419&_u=f1la2tr653e

Busy pin does not work for e-ink screen, do not know why...

landscape mode is refined from JumpZero @ https://forum.micropython.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=6319#p36047. 

The code is tested in esp8266
